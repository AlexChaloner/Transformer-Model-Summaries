# Chaloner's Transformer Wiki

> Tracking Transformers and BERTology. Chaloner 2021.

**In Progress**

What you will find here:

* Summaries of Transformer-based models
* Summaries of methods used in Transformer models
* Summaries of ablation tests
* Organised lists of model computation cost
* Organised lists of model size cost
* Performance of models vs costs

This complements [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/); we set our gaze specifically on Transformer-based models and methods, and delve deep into their ablation findings and performance-cost ratios.

## Transformer Models

In Progress:

* [Transformer]
* [ELMo]
* [BERT]
* [ALBERT]
* [XLNET]

Planned:

* RoBERTa
* DeBERTa
* T5
* GPT-1
* GPT-2
* GPT-3
* BART

## Overview Pages

Planned:

* Pretraining FLOPs vs finetuning FLOPs vs model size vs Benchmark Performance
* Attention Mechanisms
* Pretraining Methods
* Datasets
* Tokenization Methods
* Positional Encoding Methods
* Conflicting findings from papers
* Timeline
